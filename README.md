# AdvancedEmailBAW
This repo contains my Advanced Email notification asset for IBM BAW. 
You might find it useful when you need to customize task notifications in IBM BAW. 
Use as is or take just the idea. You can ask me through git, but I don't provide any support for this formally.

# How TO
The TWX file has been split into two pieces because of github file size limits. Please merge .001 and .002 and use .twx extension to recover the TWX file. I used Total Commander on Windows to split the files. Once you have the .twx file just upload it to Workflow Center and start using.

A presentation is also included in a PDF format for explanation and instructions.

A video is also available explaining how to use it on Youtube:
